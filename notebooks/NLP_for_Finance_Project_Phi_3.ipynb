today, which we believe help to facilitate comparisons across periods and with our peers.\\nFor any non-GAAP measures we reference, we provide a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure.\\nLet me start out by saying that the third quarter was a clear demonstration of us walking the talk.\\nTop-line production exceeded recently increased guidance with productivity gains from both new and existing wells in the Permian Basin.\\nThis outperformance dropped directly to strong bottom-line free cash flow as operating expenses and capital continue to benefit from our focus on best practices and realized efficiencies.\\nCapital spending for the quarter came in at $115 million, below the bottom end of guidance, which was also lowered with the recent guidance update.\\nOur operations team made strides on numerous project fronts, lowering our overall LOE run rate while also reducing our environmental footprint.\\nOur near-term focus is simple: employ a scaled co-development model across a diversified portfolio of core investment opportunities to drive rapid deleveraging from leading cash margins.\\nThis focus is best exemplified by an expected reduction in our net debt-to-EBITDA to under two and a half times by year-end.\\nThis progress reflects a leverage improvement of two turns since the first quarter, which is among the best rates of change in the industry.\\nImportantly, through thoughtful co-development of our resource base, we maintain a life-of-field development view that preserves longer-term inventory quality and depth, supporting capital efficiency and free cash flow sustainability over time.\\nWe recently completed a strategic consolidation transaction in the Delaware Basin, increasing our footprint to 110,000 net acres in the basin.\\nThe acquisition of the Primexx assets, which we announced along with our second quarter earnings, closed at the beginning of October, and we are well on our way with the integration process.\\nWe have been very pleased with recent results from the properties as activity resumed at the beginning of the year, targeting two primary zones with new generation completion designs and refined landing zones.\\nEarly time productivity has been evident with average peak oil rates of over 1,200 barrels of oil per day across 19 wells in the Wolfcamp A and B, and longer-term performance has also been attractive with 180-day average cumulative oil production of approximately 120,000 barrels of oil, which represents over 72% of the hydrocarbon mix on a two-stream basis.\\nWhile we won't have the chance to incorporate Callon's completion designs into new wells until later this year, we've been able to use our more conservative flowback strategy on a recent three-well project in the area.\\nThe combined well package is responding favorably to the modification with all three wells performing ahead of the project type curve through the first 20 days online.\\nIn addition, we are currently transitioning development on the acquired assets to the Callon philosophy of scaled co-development.\\nThis transition is currently focused on building an inventory of drilled wells to support larger average project sizes with our initial three projects in 2022 slated to average six wells a piece.\\nAs we look a little deeper into 2022, the large majority of our development program will focus on both the Delaware and Midland Basins, with the Eagle Ford returning to more of a supporting role.\\nWe've talked at length about the optionality that our diversified portfolio offers in terms of cash conversion cycles and returns on capital.\\nBut we were unable to fully optimize investment in the Delaware Basin over the last two years as we focused on shorter cash conversion cycle projects.\\nThe scale and scope of our Permian position and associated core inventory of over 1,100 locations in the Delaware alone enable us to establish a durable program that builds on substantial project-level returns on capital to support a robust free cash flow profile through mid-cycle commodity pricing.\\nDespite the significant uplift we have seen in the forward curve for oil, we intend to maintain our capital reinvestment framework based on more conservative planning prices that reflect a longer-term outlook and focus on continued simplification of the capital structure and deleveraging on both the net debt-to-EBITDA and absolute-debt basis.\\nSince the second quarter of 2020, we have laid out plans and consistently executed on strategic financial initiatives that have dramatically changed our outlook and allowed us to get back on our front foot.\\nAs part of that execution, multiple noncore monetizations have produced cash proceeds of roughly $210 million in 2021.\\nWe expect that these last few transactions announced since early October, including a smaller monetization of select water disposal assets, to close by year-end, which will put us near the top end of our guidance range of $125 million to $225 million of proceeds for the year.\\nThese proceeds, combined with our 2021 free cash flow generation expectations have established a tangible path to bring leverage under two times by mid-2022 and subsequently drive to our next round of targets of debt-to-EBITDA below one and a half times and absolute leverage of under $2 billion.\\nGiven this trajectory, in addition to our focus on sustainability and the importance of controlling critical operations in our core areas, we believe that retaining our larger portfolio of water gathering, recycling and disposal assets provides the greatest value proposition for our shareholders.\\nAs such, we are not pursuing additional monetizations related to water assets at this time.\\n\",

            "{'document': \"With me on the call today are Seamus Grady, chief executive officer; and TS Ng, chief financial officer.\\nWe delivered a strong performance in the first quarter with revenue and earnings that were above our guidance.\\nDemand trends appear to be stabilizing in most of the end markets we serve, and we're optimistic that we are positioned to deliver strong results in the second quarter.\\nRevenue in the first quarter was $399 million, a slight decrease from the record fourth quarter as expected with a 6% increase from a year ago.\\nNon-GAAP net income was $0.86 per share, exceeding the high end of guidance as gross margins improved to 12% in the quarter.\\nLooking at our business by end markets.\\nOptical communications revenue of $302 million was up about $2 million from the fourth quarter and represented 76% of total revenue.\\nWithin optical communications, telecom revenue of $230 million increased 7% from the fourth quarter and represented 76% of optical revenue.\\nThis growth is particularly notable considering we had expected telecom revenue to be flat at best.\\nFurther, we expect this momentum to continue in Q2.\\nDatacom revenue was $73 million in the quarter, an expected decrease from Q4, of 15%.\\nDatacom represented 24% of optical communications revenue.\\nWe believe this decline is primarily the result of broader industry trends and not due to execution or competitive issues.\\nIn fact, based on anticipated near-term demand, we believe datacom trends could be nearing the bottom and we expect datacom revenue to be roughly flat in Q2.\\nBy technology, silicon photonics based optical communications revenue decreased from the fourth quarter to $77 million and represented 25% of optical communications revenue.\\nRevenue from QSFP28 and QSFP56 transceivers was $45 million, down slightly from fourth quarter.\\nBy data rate, 100-gig programs continued to represent nearly half of optical communications' revenue at $147 million.\\nAnd products rated at speeds of 400 gig and above were up strongly from the fourth quarter of $38 million or 13% of optical communications revenue.\\nLooking at our nonoptical communications business.\\nRevenue moderated sequentially as expected to $97 million from $105 million in Q4.\\nAs anticipated, revenue from industrial lasers declined from the fourth quarter and was $41 million compared to $53 million in Q4.\\nThese same demand trends seem to be persisting, so we anticipated industrial laser revenue to be roughly flat in Q2.\\nLonger term, we remain optimistic about our potential to further penetrate the industrial laser market as more manufacturers inevitably turn to outsourcing to better compete in this global market that is, in fact, larger than the optical communications market.\\nAutomotive and sensor revenue were both stable at $24 million and $3.5 million, respectively.\\nFinally, revenue generated from other nonoptical applications grew 15% sequentially to $28 million, mainly from Fabrinet West.\\nFabrinet West has been a great success for winning business for our offshore volume manufacturing sites.\\nWe have seen numerous programs migrate from early prototyping in Fabrinet West to volume production in Thailand.\\nAt the same time, Fabrinet West has been an enabler for us to win business in new markets and with new customers that might have otherwise gone to competitors.\\nAs such, we have been focused on establishing a similar model to Fabrinet West in Israel.\\nWe already have a number of customers there, and we believe we have the opportunity to grow our business with these customers as well as attract new ones.\\nWe have signed a lease for a building in [Inaudible] which is a former semiconductor manufacturing facility.\\nIt is already equipped with most of the infrastructure we need for a new product introduction center.\\nWe are currently in the process of setting up SMT lines advance packaging and a failure analysis lab similar to what we have to support NPI in our Bangkok facilities.\\nWe have hired a general manager for Fabrinet Israel and we are targeting to be up and running early next year.\\nIn summary, we believe we are off to a good start to the fiscal year with revenue and earnings that meet our guidance ranges and return to gross margins that were within our target range.\\nWe're optimistic that our telecom strength will continue and the datacom trends appear to be bottoming.\\nIn addition, we're excited to have achieved important milestones toward establishing a second new product introduction facility at Fabrinet Israel.\\nCombined with our continued leadership as a contract manufacturer for the most complex products, we are very excited about our future.\\nI will provide you with more details on our performance by end market and our financial results for Q1 as well as our guidance for Q2 for fiscal year 2020.\\nTotal revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $399.3 million and above the upper end of our guidance range.\\nNon-GAAP net income was $0.86 per share and was also above our guidance range even after a foreign exchange headwind of $1.9 million and the mark-to-market loss on interest rate swap contracts of $1.7 million.\\nThese losses accounted for approximately $0.09 per share.\\nNow turning to the details of our P&L.\\nWe were pleased to see non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter improve to 12%, a 20-basis-point increase from the fourth quarter as efficiency more than offset the impact of merit increases.\\nNon-GAAP operating expense was $11.6 million in the first quarter.\\nAs a result, non-GAAP operating income was $36.2 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 9.1%, flat with the fourth quarter.\\nTaxes in the quarter were $2.2 million, and our normalized effective tax rate was less than 5%.\\nWe expect our effective tax rate to be 5% to 6% for the full year.\\nNon-GAAP net income was above our guidance range at $32.2 million in the first quarter or $0.86 per diluted share as I indicated earlier.\\nOn a GAAP basis, which includes share-based compensation expenses and amortizations of debt issuing costs, net income for the first quarter was $25.9 million or $0.69 per diluted share, also above the high end of our guidance.\\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\\nAt the end of the first quarter, cash, restricted cash and investments were $436.4 million compared to $444.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter.\\nOperating cash flow in the quarter was $2.6 million and with capex of $6.3 million, free cash flow was an outflow of $3.7 million in the first quarter.\\nDuring the quarter, our working capital increased to higher than normal level in support of major new program transfer.\\nThis will begin to self-correct in the second quarter as we start to consume the transfer inventory and collect receivables.\\nWe did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter.\\nAs such, $62.2 million remain in our share repurchase program and we will continue to evaluate market condition to opportunistically repurchase shares when possible.\\nI would now like to turn to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.\\nAs Seamus described, we expect a strong second quarter and anticipate that revenue will be between $408 million and $416 million.\\nFrom a margin perspective, we are optimistic that we will see efficiency continue to drive incremental improvements in non-GAAP gross margin within our target range of 12% to 12.5%.\\nFrom an earnings per share perspective, we anticipate non-GAAP net income per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.94 and GAAP net income per share of $0.74 to $0.77 based on approximately $37.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding.\\nIn conclusion, we are excited with our strong performance in the quarter.\\nWe remain very positive about our long-term prospects for continued leadership in the marketplace.\\n\", 'summary': 'fabrinet q1 earnings per share $0.69.\\nq1 non-gaap earnings per share $0.86.\\nq1 gaap earnings per share $0.69.\\nsees q2

year's COVID-impacted leasing velocity and the emerging Delta variant was creating uncertainty around universities plans to move forward with in-person classes and a return of campus social activities.\\nAt that time, based on historical leasing velocity data, we continued to believe that the industry's COVID recovery would not fully materialize until the fall of 2022.\\nToday, just three months later, we are extremely pleased to report that students all across the nation continue to flock back to their college towns and leased well into the months of August and September, and universities continued to press forward with their plans to return to in-person activities, including full attendance at college football stadiums across America.\\nThe result, the student housing industry has emerged from the COVID pandemic in the fall of 2021 with its investment thesis fully intact and with the sector having tailwinds, the like of which we haven't seen in many years.\\nAs outlined in our interim update earlier this month, we're pleased that the execution of our fall '21 lease-up produced an opening fall occupancy of 95.8% for our total portfolio and rental rate growth of 330 to 380 basis points for our 2021 and 2022 same-store property groupings, respectively.\\nAll these metrics are above the assumptions in the high end of our prior lease-up guidance.\\nIn addition to the extremely successful lease-up, our operational and financial results also exceeded our expectations in the third quarter, with ancillary income and operating expenses beating our forecast.\\nIn addition, the ongoing development and commencement of operations at Flamingo Crossings Village, our community serving the Disney College Program, are also going quite well.\\nDuring the quarter, we delivered the fifth phase of development and have now achieved 85% occupancy, in line with our expectations for this fall.\\nNotably, since the DCP program recommenced only five months ago, we have already executed leases with and moved in more than 4,500 residents, demonstrating the continued vibrant demand for the Disney College Program.\\nOur lease-up results and recent operational outperformance allowed us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance by 4% to $2.08 per share, which is above the high end of our prior guidance range.\\nBased on the progress we've made this year, total property NOI returned to prepandemic levels this quarter, a full year earlier than we previously anticipated.\\nAnd more impressively, rental revenue is expected to exceed prepandemic levels in the fourth quarter for our same-store properties from 2019.\\nWe now expect to grow earnings by 3% to 7% over 2020.\\nAll in all, the company's recovery and financial performance this year has certainly exceeded our expectations as cumulatively, we have exceeded our original guidance for the first three quarters of the year by $0.12 per share or almost 10%, as students continue to return to college campuses throughout the year.\\nI'd like to now turn to the fundamentals of our industry.\\nAs reported by owners and operators attending the NMHC Student Housing Conference earlier this month, occupancy and supply demand fundamentals of the sector are strong.\\nAnd again, the industry is experiencing some of the most substantial tailwinds we've seen in many years.\\nThe broader comparable sector represented by the RealPage/Axiometrics 175 returned to prepandemic occupancy levels of approximately 94%, while also producing attractive rent growth of 2.5%.\\nWe saw robust admission applications at four-year public and private universities we serve and target.\\nThe strength in admission applications appears to have directly led to the highest level of first year student enrollment growth we have seen.\\nIn the 48 of 68 university markets for which we are able to collect first year enrollment data, there was an increase of 7.4% over fall 2020 and 6.4% above prepandemic fall 2019.\\nFor perspective, for four-year public institutions, in the prior 30-year period, average first year enrollment growth was approximately 2%.\\nThis level of significant growth in first year students occurring this year indicates the emerging post-COVID era demand from students wanting to attend high-quality universities in person and should provide significant recurring housing demand in the years to come.\\nThe record number of first year students, the reinstatement of on-campus housing policies and the resumption of in-person campus activities will once again allow us to implement our in-person and exclusive sports marketing program activities in the 2022 leasing season.\\nHistorically, these programs have been an integral part of our early leasing season velocity outperformance and our final fall occupancy outperformance as compared to our peers.\\nThe significant increase in first year students led to the highest level of total enrollment growth in recent years, up over 1.5% versus academic year 2020 and prepandemic academic year 2019.\\nIn 62 of the 68 ACC markets for which we've been able to collect total enrollment data, this represents the addition of over 30,000 students.\\nSector tailwinds also include a reduction in national new supply, continuing at least through the 2022-2023 academic year.\\nThis includes a projected decrease of over 25% in ACC markets and represents the lowest level of new supply we have seen in over a decade.\\nIn total, we are tracking new supply of only 15,500 beds with only 1/3 of our NOI being produced in markets seeing new supply.\\nThis compares to 55% to 67% of NOI being produced in new supply markets over the last three years.\\nWe're also seeing significant demand from universities seeking to modernize their on-campus housing.\\nDuring the quarter, we were awarded new third-party developments at Emory University and the University of Texas.\\nAnd this month, we started a new third-party development on the campus of Princeton University.\\nIn all, we are tracking more than 60 universities that are evaluating privatized residential projects, a continuing increase compared to prepandemic levels.\\nIn summing it up, we're extremely pleased with the progress that we and the sector have made in managing through the global pandemic.\\nFinally, with our sector's resiliency and investment thesis fully intact as we emerge from COVID, institutional capital is once again focusing on the sector, with several notable transactions recently occurring in the space.\\nWe are highly confident in our ability to fund our business through strategic capital recycling and free cash flow generation, while producing attractive earnings growth for our shareholders.\\nWith the sector's COVID recovery now largely complete, we believe the current transaction environment affords us the opportunity to accretively fund recent and ongoing development activity and further strengthen our balance sheet in 2022.\\nAs such, we intend to accelerate $200 million to $400 million of disposition activity, which fully satisfies our projected funding needs.\\nIncluding the strategic capital recycling, we believe that FFOM per share growth in the range of 12% to 15% is achievable in 2022.\\nBased on the positive fundamentals in the student housing industry and the accretive contribution from our ongoing development program, we are excited about the prospects for continued growth beyond 2022.\\nWe believe we are now well positioned to produce long-term earnings growth, net asset value creation and superior returns for our investors in the years ahead.\\n\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Sure!

forecast.\\nIn addition, the ongoing development and commencement of operations at Flamingo Crossings Village, our community serving the Disney College Program, are also going quite well.\\nDuring the quarter, we delivered the fifth phase of development and have now achieved 85% occupancy, in line with our expectations for this fall.\\nNotably, since the DCP program recommenced only five months ago, we have already executed leases with and moved in more than 4,500 residents, demonstrating the continued vibrant demand for the Disney College Program.\\nOur lease-up results and recent operational outperformance allowed us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance by 4% to $2.08 per share, which is above the high end of our prior guidance range.\\nBased on the progress we've made this year, total property NOI returned to prepandemic levels this quarter, a full year earlier than we previously anticipated.\\nAnd more impressively, rental revenue is expected to exceed prepandemic levels in the fourth quarter for our same-store properties from 2019.\\nWe now expect to grow earnings by 3% to 7% over 2020.\\nAll in all, the company's recovery and financial performance this year has certainly exceeded our expectations as cumulatively, we have exceeded our original guidance for the first three quarters of the year by $0.12 per share or almost 10%, as students continue to return to college campuses throughout the year.\\nI'd like to now turn to the fundamentals of our industry.\\nAs reported by owners and operators attending the NMHC Student Housing Conference earlier this month, occupancy and supply demand fundamentals of the sector are strong.\\nAnd again, the industry is experiencing some of the most substantial tailwinds we've seen in many years.\\nThe broader comparable sector represented by the RealPage/Axiometrics 175 returned to prepandemic occupancy levels of approximately 94%, while also producing attractive rent growth of 2.5%.\\nWe saw robust admission applications at four-year public and private universities we serve and target.\\nThe strength in admission applications appears to have directly led to the highest level of first year student enrollment growth we have seen.\\nIn the 48 of 68 university markets for which we are able to collect first year enrollment data, there was an increase of 7.4% over fall 2020 and 6.4% above prepandemic fall 2019.\\nFor perspective, for four-year public institutions, in the prior 30-year period, average first year enrollment growth was approximately 2%.\\nThis level of significant growth in first year students occurring this year indicates the emerging post-COVID era demand from students wanting to attend high-quality universities in person and should provide significant recurring housing demand in the years to come.\\nThe record number of first year students, the reinstatement of on-campus housing policies and the resumption of in-person campus activities will once again allow us to implement our in-person and exclusive sports marketing program activities in the 2022 leasing season.\\nHistorically, these programs have been an integral part of our early leasing season velocity outperformance and our final fall occupancy outperformance as compared to our peers.\\nThe significant increase in first year students led to the highest level of total enrollment growth in recent years, up over 1.5% versus academic year 2020 and prepandemic academic year 2019.\\nIn 62 of the 68 ACC markets for which we've been able to collect total enrollment data, this represents the addition of over 30,000 students.\\nSector tailwinds also include a reduction in national new supply, continuing at least through the 2022-2023 academic year.\\nThis includes a projected decrease of over 25% in ACC markets and represents the lowest level of new supply we have seen in over a decade.\\nIn total, we are tracking new supply of only 15,500 beds with only 1/3 of our NOI being produced in markets seeing new supply.\\nThis compares to 55% to 67% of NOI being produced in new supply markets over the last three years.\\nWe're also seeing significant demand from universities seeking to modernize their on-campus housing.\\nDuring the quarter, we were awarded new third-party developments at Emory University and the University of Texas.\\nAnd this month, we started a new third-party development on the campus of Princeton University.\\nIn all, we are tracking more than 60 universities that are evaluating privatized residential projects, a continuing increase compared to prepandemic levels.\\nIn summing it up, we're extremely pleased with the progress that we and the sector have made in managing through the global pandemic.\\nFinally, with our sector's resiliency and investment thesis fully intact as we emerge from COVID, institutional capital is once again focusing on the sector, with several notable transactions recently occurring in the space.\\nWe are highly confident in our ability to fund our business through strategic capital recycling and free cash flow generation, while producing attractive earnings growth for our shareholders.\\nWith the sector's COVID recovery now largely complete, we believe the current transaction environment affords us the opportunity to accretively fund recent and ongoing development activity and further strengthen our balance sheet in 2022.\\nAs such, we intend to accelerate $200 million to $400 million of disposition activity, which fully satisfies our projected funding needs.\\nIncluding the strategic capital recycling, we believe that FFOM per share growth in the range of 12% to 15% is achievable in 2022.\\nBased on the positive fundamentals in the student housing industry and the accretive contribution from our ongoing development program, we are excited about the prospects for continued growth beyond 2022.\\nWe believe we are now well positioned to produce long-term earnings growth, net asset value creation and superior returns for our investors in the years ahead.\\n\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Sure!
