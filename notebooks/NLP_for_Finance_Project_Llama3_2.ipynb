year-over-year comparability.\\nIn summary, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, delivering sales and earnings per share growth, margin expansion, and robust cash flow.\\nMost exciting we experienced record order rates for our smart water solutions across both lines of business as the underlying growth drivers for our digital solutions are embraced by customers.\\nThe well-publicized and widespread electronic supply shortages limited our conversion of these record orders into sales in the quarter.\\nTempering core sales growth but resulting in a record-high order backlog heading into the second quarter, which bodes well for the balance of the year.\\nOur recent acquisitions delivered strong top-line results with net profitability muted as expected as a result of purchase accounting items.\\nOverall, our acquisition integration activities are progressing as expected.\\nI'll talk about the current environment and our outlook later in the call.\\nAs you can see on Slide 4, total sales for the first quarter were $117.8 million compared to $108.5 million in the same period last year, an increase of 9%.\\nIn utility water, overall, sales increased 12% reflecting the addition of the s::can and ATi acquisitions, which contributed approximately $10 million of sales in the quarter.\\nExcluding acquisitions, core revenues in the utility water product line were essentially flat year-over-year despite record orders due to the Internet and electronic supply component shortages and logistics challenges that limited manufacturing output.\\nScarce capacity of electronics is a pervasive market issue impacting many industries and is not isolated to Badger Meter.\\nWe did experience growth in overall meter sales and BEACON software as a service revenue and we benefited from strategic value-based pricing actions.\\nAs Ken noted, we ended the quarter with strong order momentum and a record backlog, which gives us confidence in our sales outlook moving forward.\\nAs expected the flow instrumentation sales rate of change improved sequentially from down 10% last quarter to down 3% year-over-year, with the majority of end markets served experiencing recovering demand trends.\\nWe expect to return to overall growth moving forward as a result of improving demand conditions and easier comparisons.\\nWe are pleased with the operating profit improvement delivering a 30 basis point increase in margins to 15.1% from 14.8% in the prior year.\\nGross margin for the quarter was 41.9%, up a healthy 200 basis points year-over-year.\\nThe core business delivered higher gross margins due to positive sales mix, namely higher SaaS revenues along with favorable pricing, which continued to offset the impact of higher brass costs in the quarter.\\nMargins also benefited from favorable acquisition mix.\\nYou may recall from last quarter we described the water quality acquisitions of s::can and ATi as having higher than line average gross margins combined with higher SEA as a percent of sales and therefore with a net EBITDA range for the combined businesses in the mid-teens.\\nThe positive acquisition mix benefit to gross margins was muted by the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in the quarter, but that's mostly behind us moving forward.\\nCopper prices continued their upward trajectory after our last earnings call in late January when they were averaging approximately $3.60 a pound to now near $4.20 a pound.\\nThis obviously increases the potential cost headwind for the year that we had estimated at $4 million to $5 million to closer to $7 million to $8 million on a year-over-year basis if it were to stay in that $4.20 range.\\nWe have executed well in implementing appropriate pricing mechanisms to offset this inflation as evidenced by our first quarter results and will continue to remain nimble and actively addressing inflation.\\nTurning to SEA expenses, the first quarter spend of $31.6 million increased $4.3 million from the prior year.\\nThis includes a full quarter of SEA spending for both s:can and ATi along with the higher level of acquired intangible asset amortization.\\nBeyond the impact of acquisitions, higher personnel costs were more than offset by lower travel trade show and other ongoing pandemic impacted expenses, the decrease of which we will anniversary starting next quarter.\\nThe income tax provision in the first quarter of 2021 was 22.2%, slightly lower than the prior years' 25.6% rate.\\nIn summary, earnings per share was $0.47 in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 15% from the prior year's earnings per share of $0.41.\\nWorking capital as a percent of sales was 24.3% down from 25.5% at calendar year-end despite the addition of ATi, largely due to working capital initiatives in the quarter.\\nOur free cash flow of $28.8 million was consistent with the prior year.\\nIn early January we deployed $44 million net of cash acquired for ATi and currently have cash on the balance sheet of approximately $51 million.\\nAlong with the untapped revolver, we have significant financial flexibility to execute our growth strategies.\\nTurning to Slide 5.\\nWe don't provide guidance but believe it is important to bring awareness to the increased level of unevenness we're likely going to see in our top line as this year unfolds.\\nI want to spend just a minute highlighting comparative sales data to provide a clear picture of the varied influences on the quarterly sales growth trend lines and discuss the optimism we have for our results for the remainder of the year and beyond.\\nThis chart depicts the quarterly sales growth rate of our core business in 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021.\\nAs you can see by the various call-out boxes, we had some specific dynamics in 2020 with COVID and now in the first quarter of 2021 that we need to be mindful of as we look at the rest of the year comparisons.\\nNamely, we will have an easier comp for our upcoming Q2 versus the 2020 COVID lockdowns combined with a portion of the record backlog converting to sales given the anticipation for some modest improvement in electronic supply.\\nAs we move into Q3, we'll have a difficult comparison based on the post-COVID lockdown order rate and manufacturing recovery last year.\\nThe bottom line to all of this is that we continue to have strong momentum and robust bid activity, order rates and backlog consistent with our long-term outlook for mid-single-digit growth.\\nFrom a top line standpoint, the acquisitions are performing in line with their historic growth patterns and our integration teams are working to begin putting the steps and processes in place to realize future growth synergies.\\nTurning to our outlook.\\nThe underlying market drivers for smart water solutions remain intact and in fact, as we've discussed, COVID has spotlighted the benefits of AMi for common utility challenges such as remote work efficiencies and regular and automated consumer engagement tools.\\nWater quality and security concerns also are driving accelerating interest in our real-time digital solutions.\\nWe saw evidence of that during the recent climate events in Texas and other Southern U.S. States which experienced the debilitating deep freeze with a number of customers describe the real-life benefits of having our cellular AMi solution deployed which remained in service due to the criticality and cellular networks.\\nThese utilities were able to obtain real-time mission critical data which help identify potential main breaks, pipe freezes and bursts keeping safe water supply available for their end consumers.\\nNow surprisingly, one of the most common outlook questions we get from investors relates to the potential impact of the recent infrastructure proposal from the Biden administration, specifically the portion of the plan that calls for $56 billion of spending to upgrade and modernize America's drinking water, wastewater and stormwater systems and additional $10 billion in part to invest in rural small water systems.\\nAs we have repeatedly stated, the underlying secular trends driving demand for our digital water solutions are already evident and growing.\\nStimulus investments could perhaps accelerate or add to those underlying drivers, but are not necessary for us to realize our long-term growth plans.\\nIn fact, as we stated over the past couple of quarters, it's the widespread availability of vaccinations that are most relevant to near-term demand patterns.\\nIt's too early to tell if a potential pause in spending might occur as utilities weight and digest the implications of the stimulus proposals.\\nOur view is that if a pause would occur it would simply be a matter of timing and not a change to the long-term structural growth of our business.\\nWe will as always focus on the elements of our business within our control.\\nOur teams have done an outstanding job managing value-based pricing initiatives, which have mitigated the significant increase in brass costs, our sourcing and supply chain teams have their hands full actively managing the varied ramifications of the wide-ranging and Universal Electronics shortages along with certain logistics bottlenecks, including those at West Coast ports.\\nWhile these circumstances are not unique to Badger Meter, I am confident that we will be able to adequately support customers despite these many challenges.\\nWe will continue to manage working capital and drive cash flow in order to support our investments in both organic and acquisition-driven growth.\\nOur focus remains on enhancing the product and software offering serving water-related markets and applications globally.\\nFinally, I want to provide an update on our ESG activities notably establishing our first greenhouse gas intensity reduction target.\\nThis represents an important step on our ESG journey as we work to mitigate the impact we have on the environment and continue to be good stewards of the resources we use in our operations.\\nThe 15% intensity reduction goal by 2030 was developed through a strategic initiative to capture baseline greenhouse gas data globally and identify opportunities to reduce energy and consumption and other Level 1 and 2 emissions.\\nWe will set annual smart goals to monitor progress and we'll report externally on our efforts in our biennial sustainability report.\\n\", 'summary': 'q1 earnings per share $0.47.\\nq1 sales rose 9 percent to $117.8

other associated disclosures, including a description of the excluded and adjusted items, are available in the first quarter 2021 financial results news release, which is available on our website.\\nWe're off with an excellent start to 2021, and I'm proud of the many accomplishments we've achieved in just a few short months.\\nWe've been building momentum, and the strong operational execution of our teams is paying off as the global economy improves.\\nThere are several highlights I want to cover.\\nFirst, strong demand from the end of 2020 continued through the first quarter.\\nIn many markets, demand is returning to or exceeding 2019 levels.\\nWe reported 20% higher adjusted earnings per share over '19 and 5% over a very strong first quarter last year before we felt the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nConsistent with our track record of strong free cash flow, we also delivered record free cash flow of $125 million in the first quarter, which was up substantially from a very strong performance a year ago.\\nWe achieved these solid results despite operational logistical headwinds from winter storm Uri.\\nI'm incredibly proud of our team in Texas who took proactive steps ahead of the storm to avoid a hard shutdown to any of our assets.\\nThen they worked tirelessly to repair and restart our facilities, which helped ensure supply for our customers.\\nWe had half of our Texas manufacturing facility operational within one week of the storm, and we were more than 95% operational within three weeks.\\nMoving to other highlights, we've made significant progress with our circular economy efforts, which I'll talk more about in a moment.\\nAnd our progress hasn't gone unnoticed with Barron's adding Eastman to its list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies for 2021, a true honor for us.\\nAnd we issued our inclusion and diversity report, which you can find on our website.\\nAt Eastman, we take our environmental, social and governance commitment seriously, and transparency is of the utmost importance.\\nWe also continue to allocate our capital with returns to stockholders in mind.\\nTo that end, we recently completed a small bolt-on acquisition of 3F Feed & Food, a leading animal health and nutrition company with accelerated growth in the animal nutrition business.\\nAnd finally, we think the favorable trends in the economy, coupled with our innovation investments and continued disciplined cost management sets us up for strong earnings per share and free cash flow growth this year and next.\\nOn our January call, we gave you an update on the progress we're making to become a leader in the circular economy.\\nWe announced that we're building one of the world's largest plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling facilities at our site in Kingsport, Tennessee.\\nSince then, we've broken ground on the facility and continue to target mechanical completion by the end of '22.\\nEven more impressive is the amount of momentum we're building with customers in many different markets around the world.\\nThe demand for our new branded products include Eastman Tritan Renew, Eastman Cristal Renew, is strong.\\nAt this point, demand for our specialty products and the circular economy offerings has been better than we anticipated.\\nAnd specific to the new facility we announced, we're ahead of schedule in terms of customer demand for the capacity.\\nWe have a robust pipeline for additional announcements throughout the year and look forward to sharing those with you.\\nTurning to our outlook.\\nAs we entered the second quarter with strong demand and mix momentum, we also expect to benefit from cost discipline, including lower operating costs from our operational transformation program.\\nHowever, there are specific headwinds we face, including maintenance turnaround, supplier reliability and some slowdown in auto production.\\nIn addition, we have price increases that are continuing to catch up to higher raw material, energy and distribution costs in some products.\\nDespite these headwinds, we expect a sequential increase in EPS, with second quarter adjusted earnings per share expected to be at or above second quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $2.22.\\nMoving the full year, we expect strong market growth and product mix improvement to continue.\\nOur innovation-driven growth model will enable us to grow faster than the underlying market recovery, and we expect a number of markets will be rebuilding inventory.\\nWe also expect much of the capacity constraints, supplier reliability and logistics headwinds to lessen alongside a potential moderation in tight commodity markets.\\nWe expect to continue to benefit from about $100 million of full year tailwind for improved capacity utilization compared to last year when we aggressively managed inventory well below the decline in demand with our focus on cash.\\nAnd we're on track to keep our cost structure flat compared with 2020 and well below 2019 and '18 levels.\\nWe, therefore, expect adjusted earnings per share will be about -- be between $8.25 and $8.75 for the full year of '21.\\nOn cash, we expect free cash flow to approach $1.1 billion, which is consistent with our expectations for stronger adjusted EBITDA.\\nWe expect 2021 will be our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow greater than $1 billion, and we will work to grow free cash flow from here.\\nPutting it all together.\\nThese outstanding results remind me about what gives Eastman this incredible resiliency and strategic advantage.\\nFirst and foremost, it's the people at Eastman who continue to persevere and help us win as we saw in Uri and a time of crisis, and this is what we see every day from this good team.\\nAnd as I reflect on how we position our company through the global trade disruptions of 2019 and then COVID in '20, I feel confident in our ability to grow earnings per share and cash off this new level of earnings.\\nDespite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop over the last several years, we have not sacrificed our efforts to innovate and invest in our specialty portfolio and expect those investments to continue to pay off as we finish off '21 and move into '22.\\nIn the meantime, we'll continue to focus on what we can control and remain committed to long-term attractive earnings growth and sustainable value creation for our owners and all our stakeholders.\\n\", 'summary': 'now expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share to be between $8.25 and $8.75.\\nexpect 2021 free cash flow to

            "{'document': \"This is Michael Haack.\\nLet me start today by acknowledging that we had another solid quarter of increasing earnings, and while shaping up to be an exceptional fiscal year for Eagle Materials.\\nOur results reflect that we are entering into a cyclical phase for our businesses, where the demand for all of our products are strong.\\nThere are two overreaching reasons for this.\\nOne relates to market conditions, which are on an improving trajectory in most respects.\\nThe second relates to Eagle's high-performing, well thought geographically advantaged operations that can take advantage of these market opportunities.\\nLet me start with some foundational comments about market conditions.\\nHousing construction is an important driver for both sides of our business, and single-family starts are especially important for Gypsum Wallboard.\\nThere are positive short-term, mid-term, and long-term dimensions to the robust housing-related demand for our materials.\\nAs for the short term, Wallboard is installed on walls and ceilings in the later phase of the building construction process after framing has occurred.\\nThis means that the recent increase in starts and permits will have the greatest impact in the months ahead.\\nPandemic has resulted in a surge in home buying, and that demand that has been swelling over more than a decade of under-building is now being realized.\\nWhat is more remarkable is, even with the improved rate of home construction, we as a nation, still do not have a balanced supply and demand picture for housing.\\nHome inventories on the market remain at all time lows.\\nWe believe the annual housing supply demand imbalance is unlikely to be rectified by new construction before 2022.\\nThis is in part due to the pace of what is possible for homebuilders to get into production.\\nThis supply demand pressure will challenge housing affordability, but given the Fed's commitment to keep interest rates low for an extended period, this should translate into a multi-year construct -- a continuation of favorable mortgage rates environment.\\nAnother important end-use segment for us is repair and remodeling.\\nResearch shows that purchasers of existing homes spend money on remodeling materials in the wake of their home purchase, to make the home their own and more fully conform to their needs and tastes.\\nLonger-term trends also favor our geographic positioning.\\nThe exodus from states such as California, New York, and New Jersey to states in the Sunbelt, from Carolina to Arizona and in the U.S. Heartland, including Texas and Colorado, is expected to continue.\\nThis migration aligns well with our network of facilities within Eagle Materials.\\nWe have the in-place capacity to flex with the demand growth for Wallboard without additional capital investment.\\nWe expect to benefit from higher volumes, higher margins, and restrain cost due to our ownership positions in adjusting [Phonetic] raw materials and paper.\\nNow let me turn to the market outlook, as it relates to the Heavy side.\\nInfrastructure spend drives about half the U.S. cement demand, with residential being the next most important driver.\\nState budgets have been the lion's share of infrastructure spend for many years.\\nWe do not want to minimize the pressure that some state budgets are experiencing.\\nBut our analysis of the sources of state revenue, including sales taxes, property taxes, income taxes, and corporate taxes suggest to us that many states and cities would not be as severely affected as some might fear.\\nThis is especially relevant for many of the states in which we operate.\\nWhat our analysis shows is that income and sales tax which account for more than half of the state and the local revenues fell in calendar Q2, but states developed pre-COVID levels in Q3.\\nThe states still have choices on what to do with this money.\\nBut we maintain our expectation that even without federal support to states and cities, trend demand for cement will be sustained in low single-digits across much of our footprint.\\nOf course, state DOT's could receive further federal support with the new administration, and this would provide an uplift to infrastructure construction activity.\\nTo be clear, that activity, that multi-year federal funding bills generate generally takes years to materialize, hence demand for our products.\\nNon-residential is the smallest end-use segment for Heavy, and we continue to see short-term pressure.\\nNon-residential construction continues to be depressed by the potential dangers posed by many indoor activities.\\nThe pipeline for office projects has been significantly and involves a very geographic-dependent.\\nSpending on manufacturing buildings is beginning to see some improvement, and warehouse construction trends to be strong in many of our geographies.\\nNow let me address the second factor mentioned, which is the high-performing low-cost network of plants we have created to take advantage of the market opportunities that are presenting themselves to us.\\nOpportunities which we do see [Phonetic] in our view should continue for some time.\\nThe only limitations in our ability to capture these opportunities are in cement.\\nWe are operating at very high levels of capacity utilization today, and we are facing a tightening cycle that would challenge our resourcefulness to squeeze out every bit of production through optimization of grinding, seasonal storage, and market selection.\\nWhereas in Wallboard, we have headroom for earnings expansion through volume and price growth.\\nGoing forward, we expect price will be the most important earnings growth lever for us in cement.\\nAgainst this positive backdrop, uncertainties abound.\\nThe most important of these relate to the pandemic and getting it under control.\\nBecause of this, I do not have an update today on timing for the spin, and I won't until there are some increased visibility that we are past the potentially more disruptive effects of this pandemic.\\nWe are hopeful that vaccines will be a game changer.\\nThe optimist and we believe that risks for the business talk to the upside, and that the best is yet to come.\\nEagle's third quarter revenue was $405 million, an increase of 18% from the prior year.\\nThis increase primarily reflects contribution from the Kosmos Cement business we acquired in March.\\nAnd adjusting for the acquisition in the sale of our Northern California Concrete and Aggregates business, organic revenue improved 7%, reflecting increased cement and Wallboard sales volume and price.\\nThird quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.94, an improvement of 87%.\\nExcluding the non-routine charge, third quarter earnings per share increased 28%.\\nTurning now to segment performance, let's look at Heavy Materials results for the quarter highlighted on the next page.\\nThe Heavy Materials sector includes our Cement, Concrete, and Aggregates segments.\\nRevenue in this sector increased 21%, driven primarily by the contribution from the Kosmos Cement business.\\nOrganic cement sales prices improved 4%, and sales volume was flat with our facilities continuing to operate at very high utilization rates.\\nOperating revenues increased 31%, again reflecting the addition of the Kosmos Cement business.\\nAnd organic operating earnings increased 8%, reflecting primarily higher net cement sales prices.\\nOur Concrete and Aggregates business continued to benefit from higher organic sales volume and lower diesel fuel costs, with the margins improving significantly from the prior year.\\nMoving to the Light Materials sector on the next slide.\\nThird quarter revenue in our Wallboard and Paperboard business was up 8%, reflecting record third quarter Wallboard sales volume and a 1% increase in Wallboard sales prices.\\nFor a perspective, the December average price was [Indecipherable] per thousand square feet versus the quarterly average of $148.\\nQuarterly operating earnings in the sector increased 1% to $48 million, reflecting the increased Wallboard sales volume and prices, partially offset by higher input costs, namely recycled fiber costs.\\nLooking now on our cash flow, which remained strong.\\nDuring the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow increased 69%, reflect the earnings growth, disciplined working capital management, and the receipt of our IRS refund.\\nCapital spending declined to $46 million.\\nFinally, a look at our capital structure.\\nDuring the quarter, we continued to prioritize debt reduction as a primary use of cash, providing us significant financial flexibility in the light of pandemic-related uncertainties and potential opportunities.\\nAt December 31, 2020, our net debt-to-cap ratio was 41%, down from 60% at the end of our fiscal year.\\nAnd our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was well below 2 times.\\nWe ended the quarter with $143 million of cash on hand, and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $888 million, and we have no near-term debt maturities.\\nWe'll now move to the question-and-answer session.\\n\", 'summary': 'compname reports third quarter results earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.94 on revenue of $405

year's COVID-impacted leasing velocity and the emerging Delta variant was creating uncertainty around universities plans to move forward with in-person classes and a return of campus social activities.\\nAt that time, based on historical leasing velocity data, we continued to believe that the industry's COVID recovery would not fully materialize until the fall of 2022.\\nToday, just three months later, we are extremely pleased to report that students all across the nation continue to flock back to their college towns and leased well into the months of August and September, and universities continued to press forward with their plans to return to in-person activities, including full attendance at college football stadiums across America.\\nThe result, the student housing industry has emerged from the COVID pandemic in the fall of 2021 with its investment thesis fully intact and with the sector having tailwinds, the like of which we haven't seen in many years.\\nAs outlined in our interim update earlier this month, we're pleased that the execution of our fall '21 lease-up produced an opening fall occupancy of 95.8% for our total portfolio and rental rate growth of 330 to 380 basis points for our 2021 and 2022 same-store property groupings, respectively.\\nAll these metrics are above the assumptions in the high end of our prior lease-up guidance.\\nIn addition to the extremely successful lease-up, our operational and financial results also exceeded our expectations in the third quarter, with ancillary income and operating expenses beating our forecast.\\nIn addition, the ongoing development and commencement of operations at Flamingo Crossings Village, our community serving the Disney College Program, are also going quite well.\\nDuring the quarter, we delivered the fifth phase of development and have now achieved 85% occupancy, in line with our expectations for this fall.\\nNotably, since the DCP program recommenced only five months ago, we have already executed leases with and moved in more than 4,500 residents, demonstrating the continued vibrant demand for the Disney College Program.\\nOur lease-up results and recent operational outperformance allowed us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance by 4% to $2.08 per share, which is above the high end of our prior guidance range.\\nBased on the progress we've made this year, total property NOI returned to prepandemic levels this quarter, a full year earlier than we previously anticipated.\\nAnd more impressively, rental revenue is expected to exceed prepandemic levels in the fourth quarter for our same-store properties from 2019.\\nWe now expect to grow earnings by 3% to 7% over 2020.\\nAll in all, the company's recovery and financial performance this year has certainly exceeded our expectations as cumulatively, we have exceeded our original guidance for the first three quarters of the year by $0.12 per share or almost 10%, as students continue to return to college campuses throughout the year.\\nI'd like to now turn to the fundamentals of our industry.\\nAs reported by owners and operators attending the NMHC Student Housing Conference earlier this month, occupancy and supply demand fundamentals of the sector are strong.\\nAnd again, the industry is experiencing some of the most substantial tailwinds we've seen in many years.\\nThe broader comparable sector represented by the RealPage/Axiometrics 175 returned to prepandemic occupancy levels of approximately 94%, while also producing attractive rent growth of 2.5%.\\nWe saw robust admission applications at four-year public and private universities we serve and target.\\nThe strength in admission applications appears to have directly led to the highest level of first year student enrollment growth we have seen.\\nIn the 48 of 68 university markets for which we are able to collect first year enrollment data, there was an increase of 7.4% over fall 2020 and 6.4% above prepandemic fall 2019.\\nFor perspective, for four-year public institutions, in the prior 30-year period, average first year enrollment growth was approximately 2%.\\nThis level of significant growth in first year students occurring this year indicates the emerging post-COVID era demand from students wanting to attend high-quality universities in person and should provide significant recurring housing demand in the years to come.\\nThe record number of first year students, the reinstatement of on-campus housing policies and the resumption of in-person campus activities will once again allow us to implement our in-person and exclusive sports marketing program activities in the 2022 leasing season.\\nHistorically, these programs have been an integral part of our early leasing season velocity outperformance and our final fall occupancy outperformance as compared to our peers.\\nThe significant increase in first year students led to the highest level of total enrollment growth in recent years, up over 1.5% versus academic year 2020 and prepandemic academic year 2019.\\nIn 62 of the 68 ACC markets for which we've been able to collect total enrollment data, this represents the addition of over 30,000 students.\\nSector tailwinds also include a reduction in national new supply, continuing at least through the 2022-2023 academic year.\\nThis includes a projected decrease of over 25% in ACC markets and represents the lowest level of new supply we have seen in over a decade.\\nIn total, we are tracking new supply of only 15,500 beds with only 1/3 of our NOI being produced in markets seeing new supply.\\nThis compares to 55% to 67% of NOI being produced in new supply markets over the last three years.\\nWe're also seeing significant demand from universities seeking to modernize their on-campus housing.\\nDuring the quarter, we were awarded new third-party developments at Emory University and the University of Texas.\\nAnd this month, we started a new third-party development on the campus of Princeton University.\\nIn all, we are tracking more than 60 universities that are evaluating privatized residential projects, a continuing increase compared to prepandemic levels.\\nIn summing it up, we're extremely pleased with the progress that we and the sector have made in managing through the global pandemic.\\nFinally, with our sector's resiliency and investment thesis fully intact as we emerge from COVID, institutional capital is once again focusing on the sector, with several notable transactions recently occurring in the space.\\nWe are highly confident in our ability to fund our business through strategic capital recycling and free cash flow generation, while producing attractive earnings growth for our shareholders.\\nWith the sector's COVID recovery now largely complete, we believe the current transaction environment affords us the opportunity to accretively fund recent and ongoing development activity and further strengthen our balance sheet in 2022.\\nAs such, we intend to accelerate $200 million to $400 million of disposition activity, which fully satisfies our projected funding needs.\\nIncluding the strategic capital recycling, we believe that FFOM per share growth in the range of 12% to 15% is achievable in 2022.\\nBased on the positive fundamentals in the student housing industry and the accretive contribution from our ongoing development program, we are excited about the prospects for continued growth beyond 2022.\\nWe believe we are now well positioned to produce long-term earnings growth, net asset value creation and superior returns for our investors in the years ahead.\\n\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Sure!

Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 12.1% versus last year and 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019. The company's strong performance was driven by growth in its diversified mix of healthcare businesses, including nutritionals, established pharmaceuticals, and diabetes care. Sales growth was led by strong execution and a steady cadence of new products, such as Pedialyte and Ensure. The company also established a strong leadership position in rapid testing, including a supply capacity of more than 100 million tests per month. Overall, Abbott's third quarter results were a testament to the company's strong well-balanced growth across all of its major businesses. The company's outlook for the fourth quarter was also positive, with forecasted sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, in the low double-digits versus last year.\n"

Our government businesses continued their strong performance, delivering another quarter of year-over-year growth. We have now more than doubled our adjusted operating margin over the past two quarters, while operating in a stable revenue environment. We are also proud to have fully reinstated salaries and 401(k) benefits at the beginning of the third quarter. We generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations and remain in a strong balance sheet position with 1.1 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We also secured and executed new wins during the quarter, including expanding our distribution relationship with GE subsidiary Unison and beginning operations on our previously announced Honeywell 737 MAX EBAS contract. Our overall leverage and liquidity remain strong, with net debt of 1.1 times adjusted EBITDA, unrestricted cash of $99.2 million, and unused capacity under our revolver of over $400 million.

ARMOUR paid dividends of $0.10 per common share for each month in the fourth quarter, totaling $19.6 million. The company also declared February and March common dividends at the rate of $0.10 per share and Series C preferred stock dividends for Q1 at the rate of $0.14583 per share. ARMOUR's portfolio activity in Agency MBS is expected to continue, with a focus on concentrated portfolio activity in this segment. The company's implied leverage ratio was 7.7 at the end of the fourth quarter and 6.9 currently, indicating a cautious approach to leverage. ARMOUR's duration as of year-end was 0.62 and is currently 0.76, with a significant portion of the portfolio's duration in the key rate buckets of inside three years. The company expects the Fed's presence to persist at least for the first half of 2021, if not longer. ARMOUR's core earnings may trend a bit lower, but should work to optimize total economic return.\n"

Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.14 in the quarter, up from $1.33 in 2020. Net sales in the quarter were up 34% from the prior year, driven by increased volumes across all segments, favorable foreign currency translation, and the pass-through of higher material costs. Segment income improved to $395 million in the quarter, up from $250 million in the prior year. The company expects third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings of between $1.90 and $2 per share, with full year guidance estimated at $6.70 per share. The company is increasing its midpoint estimate for full year adjusted earnings guidance from $6.70 to $7.35 per share, assuming the sale of the Europe Tinplate business closes at the end of August. The company is also increasing its midpoint estimate for full year tax rate from 24% to 25%. The results of the European Tinplate operations are now shown as discontinued, and the company is expecting significant new capacity to be commercialized in the second half of the year. The company is also expecting beverage growth percentages for the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2019, and is confident in its ability to convert growth into expanded earnings and cash flow. Overall, the company reported a record first half for the year, with significant new capacity being commercialized and expected to be commissioned over the back half of the year.\n"

Cash flows from operations totaled $143 million year-to-date, and capital expenditures totaled $33 million year-to-date. We completed an acquisition for $27 million in the second quarter, which will be a part of the Process segment. For the full year 2020, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million, including $50 million for facility expansion projects. We completed share repurchases of $17 million net of share issuances during the quarter, bringing our total share repurchases net of issuances to $62 million for the year. We may make further opportunistic share repurchases going forward. A few final comments, looking forward to the rest of the year. Our six-week booking average by segment is currently 1.2, indicating a strong booking activity. However, the improvement has not been consistent between the segments. Our outlook for the Contractor business is positive for the second half of the year. Our Industrial business, on the other hand, experienced marginal improvement after the business tanked in April. Our Process business didn't drop as severely in April. We have stronger end markets such as semiconductor and environmental, and weaker end markets such as our lubrication business, which has performed comparably to our Industrial segment. We will continue to invest in our growth strategies, such as new product and new market development, to drive strong results once things normalize. We used a similar approach during the\n"

Our quarterly revenue was up 20%, and earnings per share were up 133% from the same period last year. We benefited from significant improvement in restructuring advisory revenue relative to recent years. Our capital advisory team had another strong performance, but fell short of the prior year's record revenue level. We also had good results in consumer products, financial services, and media, offset by weaker results in energy, healthcare, and technology. We had a strong finish to the year, resulting in respectable full-year results on the top and bottom line. We expect our interest expense to continue to decline going forward. We continue to aggressively repurchase shares given our view that the market is underestimating our earnings potential. We purchased 1.5 million shares and share equivalents during the quarter, and 3.8 million shares and share equivalents during the full year. We also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share. We entered 2020 with a favorable outlook across all of our businesses. We remain focused on building a business with increasingly diversified revenue streams and greater aggregate revenue. We have all the tools needed to continue to successfully implement our strategy. Our culture makes our firm a great place to work, leading to both recruiting success and high retention rates for strong performers. We own 48% of the economic value of our firm through common stock and restricted stock, and are highly incentivized to generate strong results and create value for all shareholders.\n"

The company's third-quarter net sales were driven by steady growth in its industrial and sports businesses, as well as increased sales in its agricultural and animal health products. However, the company faced challenges in managing its supply chain, including high demand for cat litter products driven by consumer-pantry loading during the pandemic. The company's gross profit declined by 4.9 million dollars, primarily due to higher freight, packaging, materials, natural gas, and nonfuel manufacturing costs. Oil-Dri's net income attributable to the company was 2.2 million dollars in the third quarter, compared to 4.6 million dollars during the same period in the prior year. The company's financial position remains strong, with a debt-to-total-capital ratio of about 6%. Oil-Dri's cash flow was used to fund trade working capital, and the company used cash to opportunistically repurchase stock to help offset dilution. Overall, Oil-Dri remains in a strong financial position and is well-positioned to capitalize on strategic investment opportunities.\n"

We will be discussing results that were released yesterday after the close. To listen online, please go to the stewart.com website to access the link for this conference call. Because such statements are based on an expectation of future financial operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected. In a minute, David will take you through the details of this quarter's financial results. But before then, I'd like to discuss Stewart's operational evolution to date and the continued execution of our long-term strategy. Two years ago, we started a journey here at Stewart, a journey to become the premier title services company. We knew it would take some time, but we also knew we had a valued brand, strong balance sheet, and associates that were ready and willing to have and to make an impact. Between then and now, we have navigated the dramatic impacts of COVID-19 and historic real estate market that continues to have momentum. So where are we on the journey? And what have been the main areas of focus and progress? We've made significant improvement on our operational capabilities by adding greater scale in priority markets, augmenting our core business with essential real estate technology and services, and injecting new talent and energy into a 125-year-old company. As I like to say, we are a 125-year-old start-up. Initial goals of achieving double-digit margin have been met and exceeded, albeit with the help of a very robust market. As David will discuss, Stewart's operating revenues are up almost $240 million or 40% from last year. And operating income was up over $30 million or 55% in a quarter in which the Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts purchase originations down 12% year-over-year and overall mortgage originations down 25%. So we feel we are comfortably outperforming the market and creating some real value. At this stage of our journey, we can safely say much has structurally changed and improved, but we have more work to be done. Through acquisitions, we have grown scale in many critical markets where our size once hindered profitability and prevented the efficient managing of daily operations. Scale and flexibility are critical in a business that is both seasonal and cyclical. We accelerated our restructuring in the midst of heavy transaction volume. We closed offices where we foresaw challenges going forward. And we entered two markets we\n"

            "We have a strong third quarter performance, despite operating at turndown levels. Our COVID-19 task force continues to monitor and evaluate the situation, and we have implemented policies and procedures to protect our workforce and contractors. We have also extended the Haverhill II contract with AK Steel for an additional two years, which now expires on June 30, 2025. This extension further illustrates our strength and long-term nature of our relationships with our customers. Our third quarter performance was impacted by lower sales volumes and lower operating costs, but we have managed to maintain our cost structure and add near-term stability. We have also made significant progress in reducing our cost structure and adding near-term stability by working collaboratively with our customers to address both current market challenges and longer-term supply requirements. We have a strong cash balance at the end of the quarter, and we expect working capital to reverse in the fourth quarter as we build coal inventories and prepare for an increase in production for 2021. We have also paid down a portion of the revolver borrowing as working capital charges were a source of cash this quarter. We have repurchased $7.5 million face value of SXCP notes in the third quarter and an additional $33.2 million here in Q4. We remain focused on our core businesses and have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure and adding near-term stability. We are confident in our revised financial targets and are committed to achieving these results.\n"

            "We reported earnings per share of $1.30 in the third quarter, with total revenue of $5.9 billion. Our linked quarter pre-tax pre-provision net revenue growth was 2.7%, driven by continued momentum across our fee businesses, growth in average loan balances, and continued focus on expense management. We released $310 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, supported by our outlook on the economy and better-than-expected credit quality metrics. Our book value per share totaled $32.22 at September 30, which was 1.5% higher than June 30. Our CET1 ratio was 10.2% at September 30. We highlighted strong trends in digital engagement and our starting point is about 1.1 million Business Banking relationships, which we define as businesses with under $25 million in revenue. We also discussed our payment services business, which continues to benefit from improving economic conditions and spend activity. We reported a 1.2% increase in non-interest expense compared to the second quarter, primarily reflecting higher revenue-related compensation and performance-based incentives. We highlighted our capital position, including a 10.2% common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30. We also discussed our organic growth opportunities, including a 15% to 20% growth in small business relationships and a 25% to 30% growth in related revenue. We also announced our acquisition of Union Bank, which provides a platform to achieve cost synergies, expand our distribution network, and leverage our broad product set in leading digital capabilities. We expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively stable on a linked quarter basis, excluding PPP fees. We expect total payments revenue trends to continue to strengthen in the fourth quarter, driven by improving sales volumes. We also expect a seasonal increase in amortization of tax-advantaged investments in the fourth quarter. We are positive on several fronts, including a solid growth in core loans, good fee revenue momentum, and strong credit quality. We are finishing off the year in a strong position heading into 2022 and we're excited about the many organic growth opportunities we see across the franchise.\n"

            "We appreciate your interest in Vulcan Materials and hope that you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. Our team has executed well during the first half of the year, and we reiterate our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 7% and our aggregates cash gross profit per ton expanded by 5% due to volume growth, higher pricing, and improved operating efficiencies. We achieved this despite a $25 million headwind from higher diesel and liquid asphalt costs. Our aggregates price realization is improving, and we expect the momentum to carry over to the second half. We also expect our return on invested capital to improve, and our balance sheet strength to continue to support our capital allocation strategy. We have three growth strategies: organic growth, greenfields, and M&A. We have a unique asset base spread across the most attractive geographies in the US, and our four strategic disciplines are designed to accelerate organic growth. We also have a long history of developing and opening new aggregate locations, particularly in growth corridors where acquisition opportunities may be limited. We like the flexibility that greenfields provide in regards to timing and pace of capital spending. Our third growth engine is M&A, and we are excited about the potential for this combination. We will continue to prioritize our balance sheet strength to create the flexibility and optionality necessary to support our capital allocation strategy. We have a net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.3 times, reflecting $968 million of cash on hand. We will continue to monitor the spread of the virus and ensure the health and safety of our employees and their families. We will continue to operate Vulcan for the long term, keeping our people safe and healthy, driving unit margin expansion, and improving our financial returns.\n"

The company has had a strong year, with net income of $198 million in the third quarter of 2021, compared to a loss of $61 million in the previous quarter. Adjusted net income was $142 million, with adjusted EBITDAX of $201 million. The company's production remained relatively flat, with oil production averaging 51,800 barrels of oil in the third quarter. The company has invested $67 million in capex and has drilled 10 gross 5.6 net operated wells. The company has also completed an acquisition of assets in North Dakota and divested its Redtail assets in Colorado. We expect the company's reinvestment rate in 2022 to be similar to what we saw in 2021, with a budget of around 35% of EBITDA. We are also expecting some inflationary costs and are estimating a range of high single-digit to low double-digit percentages. However, we are confident in our financial position and expect to initiate a return of capital to shareholders in some form in the first quarter of 2022.\n"

            "We had a strong start to our fiscal year, reporting earnings of $2.55 a share in Q1 versus $11.22 in the prior-year quarter. Excluding restructuring and one-time items, we generated a record $2.46 per share in earnings in Q1 compared to $0.64 in the prior-year quarter. We recognized a net after-tax restructuring gain of $5 million or $0.09 a share primarily related to the sale of a shuttered facility owned by our WSP joint venture. That compares to restructuring and impairment charges of $0.16 a share a year ago. In addition, the prior-year results included a net benefit of $10.74 per share related to our investment in Nikola Corporation. Consolidated net sales in the quarter of $1.1 billion were up significantly compared to $703 million in Q1 of last year. The improvement was primarily due to higher steel prices combined with increased volumes across most of our segments. Gross profit for the quarter increased to $219 million from $113 million a year ago and our gross margin increased to 19.7% from 16.1%. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 was a record $196 million, up from $75 million in Q1 of last year and our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is now $604 million. In Steel Processing net sales of $823 million nearly doubled from $431 million in Q1 of last year due to higher average selling prices and increased volumes. Total shipped tons were up 14% from last year's first quarter when demand was just beginning to recover from COVID-related shutdowns, particularly at our automotive customers. Direct tons in Q1 were 49% of mix, which was consistent with the prior-year quarter. We continue to see solid demand across nearly all of our major end markets, including automotive, construction, heavy truck, and agriculture. Despite the solid demand and year-over-year growth, automotive shipments could have been better, if not for the continuing semiconductor-related slowdowns. Everything we see suggest that while consumer and fleet demand for new cars remain strong, chip shortages will persist for the next several quarters and our automotive demand will be subject to some uncertainty as a result. In the current quarter, steel generated adjusted EBIT of $108 million and adjusted EBIT margin of 13% compared to $14 million and 3% in Q1 of last year. The large year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased demand, higher spreads, and arbitrage gains. In Consumer Products\n"

Key winners include property type and geographic winners, while those asset types and regions that remain challenged are being supported. The market has recovered sooner and more quickly than operating performance, with real estate investment and financing activity also recovering. The commercial real estate lending market has surpassed 2019 levels and is expected to surpass a record year in terms of lending volumes. The Apollo Commercial Real Estate Debt platform has proven to be beneficial, with new transactions totaling $1.5 billion through the first three quarters of the year. The pipeline is expected to be a mix of US and European transactions, with a focus on well-positioned high-quality properties. The loan originations year-to-date have favored Europe, with loans securing properties in Europe representing 40% of the portfolio. The credit quality across the portfolio remains stable, with a focus on making progress with focus loans. The company has expanded its Board of Directors to 10 members, with a focus on incorporating ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes. The distributable earnings for the quarter were $49 million, with GAAP net income available to common stockholders at $57 million or $0.38 per diluted share.

            "Our first quarter net income was $6.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share, which is in line with consensus estimates. We had lower parking revenue due to work guidelines restricting people to come back to work and recommending working from home. Our portfolio operating income was below our fourth quarter estimate, primarily due to lower occupancy and snow removal costs. We had some snow removal costs that were above-forecast. Our FFO contribution from unconsolidated joint ventures was $6.3 million, which is slightly below our fourth quarter guidance. Our cash and GAAP same-store yields were below our targeted range, partially due to a tenant move-out in the suburbs. Our first quarter fixed charge and interest coverage ratios were 4.1 and 3.8 times respectively, which remain consistent with the fourth quarter. We expect our annualized net debt-EBITDA to increase to 6.5 and is above our current range. We have some general assumptions about our portfolio and operational platform, which remains in solid shape. We have a strong leasing pipeline, with an increase of 23% during the quarter, and are seeing a trend of flight to quality among tenants. We have two fully approved mixed use master plan sites that can double our existing inventory, diversify our revenue stream, and drive significant earnings growth. Our planned 3 million square feet of life science at development can create a real catalyst to accelerate the overall pace of development of Schuylkill Yards. We have a very attractive CAD growth over the last five years and have created a very well covered and attractive dividend that's poised to grow as we increase earnings.\n"

Our quarterly revenue was 3% higher than last year, and we've made good progress on our recruiting goals. We're also pleased with our operations, with most offices having at least some people back from home and some operating normally. We've accelerated our debt paydown and are making good progress on our recruiting goals. We're also seeing a lot of good candidates for our M&A business. We've had a good start to the year, with consistent industry statistics and a rebound in economic activity. We're supplementing our traditional restructuring activity with an increased emphasis on financing advisory work. We're also seeing a lot of good candidates for our private capital advisory business. We expect to have a fully functioning global team for our private capital advisory business by the end of the year. We're lowering our compensation costs and increasing our non-compensation costs. We're also reducing our interest expense and paying down debt. We ended the quarter with $87.9 million of cash and $326.9 million of debt. We paid down another $20 million of debt since quarter end. We declared our usual $0.05 quarterly dividend and bought back just under a million shares and share equivalents for a total cost of $14.5 million. We have $35.5 million of repurchase authority available for the year ahead through next January. Our employees currently own about half of the economics of the firm through stock and restricted stock, and are fully aligned in trying to drive shareholder value.\n"

            "We are pleased to report that GameStop has had a successful quarter, with net sales increasing 25.6% to $1.183 billion. This growth is driven by the company's efforts to focus on long-term opportunities, including expanding its fulfillment network and investing in technology. We have also strengthened our balance sheet and capital position by raising over $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the June ATM program. Our SG&A was $372.3 million, or 31.5% of sales, compared to $336.9 million, or 35.8% of sales, in the same period last year. We reported a net loss of $61.6 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $111.3 million, or loss per diluted share of $1.71, in the prior-year second quarter. We ended the quarter with cash and restricted cash of $1.775 billion, which is just over $1 billion higher than the end of the second quarter last year. We also raised approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds through the issuance of 5 million shares of common stock under an ATM. Our global store count was 4,642 at the end of the quarter, and we are focused on positioning GameStop to scale while obsessing over competitive pricing, expansive selection, and fast shipping. We are also investing in growth initiatives and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Let me now turn to our financial results for the quarter. We reported net sales of $1.183 billion, which is a 25.6% increase from the same period in 2020. We achieved this growth while overcoming a roughly 9% reduction in our global store fleet due to de-densification efforts and ongoing store closures across certain international markets due to the pandemic. We believe net sales is the primary metric by which stockholders should assess the company's execution.

            "We discussed our operational and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Avi Goldin, our Chief Financial Officer, followed with a deeper dive into the quarter's financial results. The first quarter was impacted by unusually severe weather events that led to massive spikes in wholesale electricity prices in Texas and Japan. The severe winter storms in Texas and Japan had an aggregate negative impact on income from operations of approximately $15.5 million. In Texas, where the impact of the storm this quarter was approximately $13 million, our industry has borne a disproportionate share of the financial burden. We remain hopeful that perspective legislation and regulatory changes and/or litigation will provide material relief. Because of our ongoing commitment to financial strength and liquidity, our balance sheet remains in good shape. We achieved a record first quarter revenue and added to our meter and RCE counts, even though the first quarter is a historically slow quarter for customer acquisition. RCEs increased by 10,000 to 450,000 and meters increased by 7,000 to 572,000. At Genie Retail Energy, absent the Texas storms impact, our domestic business would likely have achieved record adjusted EBITDA despite the challenges of the pandemic environment. Revenue in this quarter was the highest in our history. Bottom line results would have been similarly strong had it not been for the losses incurred as a result of the winter storm Uri in Texas and extreme weather in Japan. Nevertheless, our careful forward hedging and demand management programs, the diversification of our business operations and a strong balance sheet enable us to not only manage through the volatility, but to finish the quarter with sufficient capital and liquidity to finance and prioritize our growth initiatives. Consolidated revenue increased 30% to $135 million. Revenue at Genie Retail Energy International, revenue increased to $42 million from $7 million in the year-ago quarter. The $35 million increase predominantly reflects our purchase of the outstanding stake in our Orbit joint venture in the U.K. during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the consolidation of its results. For comparison purposes, Orbit Energy generated $19.6 million in revenue in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, expansion of our customer bases in Scandinavia and the U.K. also contributed meaningfully to the revenue increase. Genie Renewables revenue was $2.5 million, a decrease from $18 million in the year-ago quarter. Consolidated gross profit decreased $11.4 million to $17.5 million. We estimate that the winter storms in Texas\n"

Our supply chain team faced challenges, including availability of container capacity and pricing surcharges due to scarcity. Despite these challenges, we were able to receive approximately 10% more product in Q1 versus Q4. Our distribution, home delivery, and service teams adjusted to the headwinds and resumed normal operations after a one-week delay. We also opened a new store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and a design-oriented store in Central Florida this summer. We expect to open a third store in Northeast Austin, Texas later this year. Our financial results for the quarter were strong, with delivered sales of $236.5 million, a 31.8% increase over the prior year quarter. Our gross profit margin increased 160 basis points from 55.5% to 57.1% due to better merchandising, price, and mix, and less promotional activity. Our financial model has substantial operating leverage at these sales levels, and we expect our net income for the first quarter of 2021 to be $19.4 million or $1.04 per diluted share on our common stock. We also paid $4 million of dividends during the first quarter of 2021. Our capex for the quarter was $4.7 million, and we paid $4 million of dividends. We expect our gross margins for 2021 to be between 56.5% and 57%. We anticipate gross profit margins will be impacted by our current estimate of product and freight costs and changes in our LIFO reserve. Our fixed and discretionary type SG&A expenses for 2021 are expected to be in the $265 million to $268 million range, a slight increase over our previous 2021 estimate due to rising benefit costs.

We are in the early stages of construction of a produced water disposal system adjacent to our South Ranch and expect to have our first produced water well drilled in the first half of this year.

Net earnings for the quarter were $1.61 per diluted share, up from $0.93 per diluted share in the prior year. The main contributors to this growth were the $140.2 million increase in irrigation segment revenues, driven by higher equipment sales volume and average selling prices. However, the segment was partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in engineering services revenue. The international irrigation markets saw a 62% increase in revenues, driven by higher equipment sales volumes in most markets. The operating margin improved to 17.1% of sales, up from 16.1% in the prior year. However, the margin headwinds in North America are expected to continue through the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The infrastructure segment saw a 21% decrease in revenues, driven by lower sales of the Road Zipper system. However, the segment still managed to maintain a 17.3% operating margin. Overall, the third quarter results reflect a challenging environment for the company, with lower revenues and a less favorable margin mix compared to the prior year.\n"

We also announced collection of 98% of rents due for April. Our collection results are a significant improvement over the prior quarter, with a 20 basis point increase in occupancy. We also reported that we collected $2.2 million of receivables from cash basis tenants and $2.8 million of lease termination fee income, which is more than typical. We also acquired 29 new properties in the quarter for $106 million, at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4%. We sold 11 properties, raising $17.6 million of proceeds to reinvest in new acquisitions. Our balance sheet remains solid, with $311 million of cash and no material debt maturities until 2024. We ended the quarter with $311 million of cash on hand. Our weighted average debt maturity is now 13.3 years, with a 3.7% weighted average fixed income interest rate. Our next debt maturity is $350 million, with a 3.9% coupon in mid-2024. Net debt to gross book assets was 34.7% at quarter end, and net debt-to-EBITDA was 5.0 times at March 31. Interest coverage was 4.6 times and fixed charge coverage was 4.1 times for the first quarter of 2021. We are well-positioned to meet our 2021 acquisition guidance with available capital.

These items added just under $0.03 per share to our results. Today, we reported AFFO per share was $0.76 per share for the first quarter, which is $0.07 per share higher than the preceding fourth quarter $0.69. We also reported that rent collections continue to drift higher, with collections of approximately 97% for the first quarter, 98% for April rent collection. Most notable collections from our cash basis tenants, which represent approximately $50 million or 7% of our annual base rent, improved to approximately 80% for the first quarter.\n"

We are highly confident that we will achieve our 1 million square foot growth for the year. Our large renewal at DC-6 is still in the process of being finalized, but we are confident that it will remain in our building. We also completed 197,000 square feet of development projects, including a 265,000 square foot data center shell in Northern Virginia. We are in advanced negotiations on a 250,000 square foot lease at Redstone Gateway, which we expect to complete in the third and fourth quarters. Our cash rents on renewals rolled up 0.1%, and our annual escalations averaged 2.6%. We expect to complete these R&M projects in the third and fourth quarters, which will impact our same property cash NOI and FFO per share as shown on page 18 of the results deck. We are maintaining our full year occupancy guidance of 90% to 92%, which takes into account the negative impact of joint venturing fully occupied wholly owned datacenter shells and the unexpected vacancy of a 121,000 square foot contractor building at Redstone Gateway in December. We are increasing our full year guidance from $2.19 to $2.25 to a new range of $2.24 to $2.28, which implies 5.7% to 7.5% growth over 2020 results and 6.6% at the midpoint.

            "We are standing in for Tracy today, and I'm here to summarize the supplemental document. The document is available on our website at prologis.com under investor relations. The statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates. We have provided a reconciliation to those measures, and Tom will please begin. The fourth quarter closed out a year of record-setting activity across our business. Core FFO was $1.12 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.05. For the full year, core FFO was $4.15 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.06. Excluding promotes, core FFO grew 14% year over year. Net effective rent change on rollover accelerated to 33%, up 510 basis points sequentially, and was led by the U.S. at over 37%. Average occupancy was 97.4%, up 80 basis points sequentially. Cash same-store NOI growth remained strong at 7.5% for the quarter and 6.1% for the full year. We're modifying our in-place to market rent disclosure to standardize this metric among logistics REITs. This collaboration is an extension of the work we've done to harmonize other property operating metrics. We have collectively defined net effective lease mark-to-market of our operating portfolio as the growth rate from in-place rents to market rents. This now aligns with how rent change on rollover is expressed. Using this new definition consistently applied, our net effective lease mark-to-market at year-end jumped almost 800 basis points sequentially to 36%. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI of more than $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share that we will capture without any further market rent growth. Turning to strategic capital, we completed the early wind up of our highly successful UKLV venture. UKLV's $1.7 billion of operating assets were contributed to our PELF and PELP Ventures, we earned net promote income of $0.05 in connection with the closeout of this venture and our percentage of infinite life vehicles has consequently grown to 95% of our $66 billion of third-party assets under management. For the year, our team raised $4.4 billion of third-party equity. After drawing down $1.9 billion in our open-ended funds for acquisitions during the year, equity Qs stood at a record $4 billion at yearend. On the deployment front, we had\n"

First, we're pleased to announce that our customer communication and engagement efforts have improved significantly, with customer enrollment in our Cool Rewards program surpassing 36,000 connected smart thermostats. We're also working on a customer bill redesign project to simplify customer bills. We appreciate the feedback from our customer advisory and stakeholder advisory boards, which have been instrumental in our progress. We're also making progress on procuring additional clean energy, including the addition of 141 megawatts of battery storage to be located on six of our APS-owned solar sites. We're also exploring partnerships with our customers to expand our microgrid offerings. We expect to narrow the potential projects under review to a smaller pool soon. On the regulatory front, the Commission is evaluating the clean energy rules preliminarily approved last year. We're scheduled to discuss the clean energy rules at our open meeting today. The Commission may hold their final vote today or they may choose to continue the discussion. We believe the rate case record is sufficient, and adjustors provide substantial benefit to customers by supporting both critical programs and reflecting changes in utility cost that can be properly passed on to customers. We're currently expecting a decision on the rate case to be issued during the third quarter of 2021. Turning to our 2021 goals, we've made progress toward improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationship, and continuing to execute our clean energy commitment as three key priorities. We've also made progress toward customer growth, with 2.1% customer growth and positive weather-normalized sales growth. We're continuing to support economic development through our customer and sales growth. Chris Camacho, the Greater Phoenix Economic Council President and CEO, is here to discuss the expansion of businesses in the Phoenix area. We're also seeing a significant increase in industrial construction, with a 76% increase in new industrial space in 2021. This represents a 76% increase over last year for industrial construction. We're well-positioned to address future changes through our existing TEAM adjustor mechanism. Finally, I'll cover our first quarter 2021 financial results. We're starting the call with a few key points. First, we're pleased to announce that our customer growth has exceeded expectations, with 2.1% customer growth.

            "The company reported a net loss of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to the loss of $1.5 million in the refined coal segment. The company's sales for the quarter increased by 6.7% to 65.9 million gallons, while the full-year sales were 235.3 million gallons, down 6.7% from the prior year. The company's gross profit for the ethanol and by-products segment increased to $8.1 million in the fourth quarter, driven by improved crush spreads. However, the refined coal segment had a gross loss of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter, due to lower demand at the facility. The company's SG&A expense increased to $5.6 million in the fourth quarter, largely due to higher ethanol freight charges. Despite the challenges, the company reported a net income of $4.4 million in the fourth quarter, and a diluted earnings per share of $0.70. The company is currently facing challenges due to low oil prices, low ethanol prices, and COVID-19, but is confident in its ability to pivot and improve its performance. The company is also exploring a carbon sequestration project at One Earth Energy, which is expected to have excellent reservoir quality. However, the project is still in the early stage and is not yet feasible. The company has a cash reserve of $205 million and is considering buybacks and other options to improve its financial position. Overall, the company reported a net loss of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, but is confident in its ability to improve its performance in the future.\n"

We generated total adjusted EBITDA of $202 million, up slightly from the previous quarter. We had higher results in each of our entities, supported by our large portfolio of long-term contracts in our gas shipping business, higher spot tanker rates in our oil shipping business, and higher revenues from our marine services business in Australia. We are expecting the second quarter to be lower than the first quarter, mainly due to a heavy dry dock schedule in both our gas and tanker fleets. We have made significant positive progress toward the strategic objective of winding down our FPSO segment, which we expect will result in a material reduction in our total asset retirement obligations in the second quarter. We have published our 11th consecutive Teekay Group sustainability report, which aligns with global frameworks such as GRI and SASB. We have successfully completed Phase 1 of our decommissioning project with net costs below budget, and we expect to incur approximately $5 million to $6 million of costs relating to the towage and initial milestone payments to the recycling yard in Q2. We are currently on track to satisfy the conditions for the decommissioning project, and the Foinaven FPSO is expected to be redelivered to us in the first half of 2022. We have made good progress on winding down our FPSO segment, and we expect to have largely eliminated our remaining exposure to both the Banff and Foinaven FPSOs. We are expecting a material reduction in our net asset retirement obligation or ARO liabilities in the second quarter, mainly due to the conditions precedent relating to the Banff decommissioning agreement. We are also expecting a significant reduction in our costs relating to the recycling of the Banff FPSO, which is expected to be covered by a fixed contractual lump-sum payment from the customer. Lastly, we are expecting to have largely eliminated our remaining exposure to the Hummingbird FPSO, which is expected to be redelivered to us in the first half of 2022.\n"

We also generated total adjusted EBITDA of 182 million, up from 165 million in the previous quarter. Our Q4 results were stronger mainly due to a modest improvement in spot tanker rates.

We completed the sale of all of our interest in Teekay LNG to Stonepeak in January 2022, bringing in gross cash proceeds of approximately 641 million to Teekay Parent. We've expanded our asset light marine services business in Australia through a new strategic long-term contract with the Australian Government Department of Defense in September last year. We've had a presence in Australia since 1997 and we are now providing services for nine Australian government vessels, which provides a solid and profitable foundation to further grow this business. We're now planning for the decommissioning of our remaining two FPSOs, which we received formal notifications from our customers and expect the contracts to end in May and August 2022, respectively. Hummingbird's decommissioning process is well advanced and relatively straightforward. The Foinaven decommissioning and recycling cost is expected to be largely covered by contractual payment from the customer. As Vince mentioned earlier, we completed the sale of all our interest in Teekay LNG to Stonepeak with Teekay Parent realizing total shareholder return of 203% and an annual IRR of 12.5% since TGP's IPO in 2005. We've now transitioned all the gas employees to TGP, which is being rebranded as CP, and we expect the remaining restructuring and transition activities to be completed throughout 2022. We look at Teekays current portfolio, which includes a number of transition activities that will continue throughout 2022 as we are evolving both our organization structure and our business mix. We're excited about the opportunities to create shareholder value with a lean organizational structure and stronger balance sheet.
